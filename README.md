WIP Doom engine launcher that updates mods via Git.

Implentation plan, wanted features:

- Cross platform
- Optional: looks almost as cool as [Accensi's Acecorp Launcher](https://accensi.gitlab.io/acecorpengineering/acecorp-launcher.html)
- Updates Doom mods via git
    - Consider zipping the repo before running, it might reduce memory in GZDoom/UZDoom
    - Explore ways to update mods and wads that aren't in a git repo

### Wishlist:
- Can create mod bundles you can send to a friend, to make it easier for them to run the exact same mods you are for multiplayer
    - Make sure this isn't a bad idea? Copyright issues? Malware?
